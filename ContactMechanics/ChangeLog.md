v0.50.0 (31Jul19)
-----------------

Overview:

- MPI parallelization of topographies, substrates and interaction.
- Updated reader framework that supports loading files in parallel. This requires to peek at the files (without
  loading them) to understand the number of grid points to decide on a domain decomposition strategy.

Technical:

- Use MPI wrapper provided by NuMPI (https://github.com/IMTEK-Simulation/NuMPI) for serial calculations.
- Switch to parallel L-BFGS of NuMPI. 
- Removed Cython dependencies. (Parallel) FFT is now handled by muFFT (https://gitlab.com/muspectre/muspectre).
- Tests have been partially converted to pytest. Parallel tests are run through run-tests
  (https://github.com/AntoineSIMTEK/runtests).

v0.32.0 (15Jul19)
-----------------

- Autocorrelation and power-spectrum updates. Both now have an option 'algorithm' that let's the user select
  between a (fast) FFT and a (slow) brute-force implementation.
  
v0.31.3 (7Jul19)
----------------

- Removed check for existing forces on boundaries (nonperiodic calculations only).

v0.31.1 (20May19)
-----------------

- Bug fix: Contact calculations now also run with detrended/scaled topographies.
- Updated hard wall command line script to new topography interface.

v0.31.0 (5Mar19)
----------------

- Added height-difference autocorrelation and variable bandwidth analysis for nonuniform
  line scans.
- Added wrapper 'to_nonuniform' function that turns uniform into nonuniform line scans.
- Bug fix: 'center' detrend mode for nonunform line scans now minimizes rms height.

v0.30.0 (15Feb19)
-----------------

Overview:

- Added non-uniform line scans, which can be loaded from text files or constructed from arrays.
- New class structure for topographies and line scans (for easier maintenance).
- Major API changes and several bug fixes (see below).
- Added Hardwall simulation tutorial.
- Added calculation for second derivative and RMS curvature for nonuniform topographies.
- Added coordination counting for contact patches. 
- Simplified computation of perimeter using coordination counting.
- Started Sphinx documentation with notes how to use the package.

API Changes:

- New API for generating topographies and line scans (height containers) from data, 
  please use "from PyCo Topography import Topography, NonlinearLineScan, UniformLineScan" now.
- New API for building pipelines using methods on height containers, e.g. "topography.scale(2).detrend()".
- Uniform topographies and line scans can be periodic.
- Removed unit property from height containers. Units are now stored in the info dictionary,
  which has to be set on generation of the height container.
- All topographies must have a physical_sizes. Readers use the resolution as the default physical_sizes 
  if the files contain no physical_sizes information. 
- Removed 'shape' alias to 'resolution' property for height containers.
- Size + shape are now always tuples, physical_sizes is also always set as tuple.
- Topographies can now be pickled and unpickled.  
- Replaced class 'Sphere' with generator function 'make_sphere'.
- Contact with "FreeFFTElasticHalfSpace": 
  Now an error is raised when points at the outer ring of the surface are interacting. 
  See notebook "examples/Hardwall_Simulation.ipynb".
  
Bug fixes:
   
- periodicity was ignored in calculation of the distance between contact patches in `distance_map`
- computation of energy in fourier space didn't match the computation of energy in real space 
  (however it is not used in actual simulation)   
- Removed keyword "full_output" from shift_and_tilt().
- Text files without spaces at beginning of line can be read now.
- Enable reading topography data from memory buffers and from binary streams.
- Calculation of 2D autocorrelation function was broken, e.g. radial average.
- 1D autocorrelation was broken for nonperiodic calculations.

  have undefined (missing) data points in surfaces. Polonsky & Keer can handle
  this now.
- Polonsky & Keer can now optimize at constant pressure (in addition to
  constant displacement)
- Updated hard wall script to accept command line arguments.
