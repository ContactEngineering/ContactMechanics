# This is the most minimal-idiotic way of discovering the version that I
# could come up with. It deals with the following issues:
# * If we are installed, we can get the version from package metadata,
#   either via importlib.metadata or from pkg_resources. This also holds for
#   wheels that contain the metadata. We are good! Yay!
# * If we are not installed, there are two options:
#   - We are working within the source git repository. Then
#        git describe --tags --always
#     yields a reasonable version descriptor, but that is unfortunately not
#     PEP 440 compliant (see https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). We need to
#     mangle the version string to yield something compatible.
# - If we install from a source tarball, we need to parse PKG-INFO manually.
