Welcome to PyCo's documentation!
================================
Contact mechanics with Python. This code implements computation of contact geometry and pressure of a rigid object on a flat elastic half-space. All calculations assume small deformations; in that limit, the contact of any two objects of arbitrary geometry and elastic moduli can be mapped on that of a rigid on an elastic flat.
